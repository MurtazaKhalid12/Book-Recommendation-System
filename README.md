## Project Overview

This project is a **Book Recommendation System** that suggests books to users based on their preferences. The system uses a dataset from Kaggle, processes the data to extract meaningful features, and implements a recommendation algorithm using **similarity scores**. The system is deployed as a user-friendly web application using **Flask**.

---

## Features

- **Popularity-Based Recommendations**: Recommends books based on their popularity (e.g., highest ratings, most reviews).
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Uses similarity scores (e.g., Euclidean distance or cosine similarity) to recommend books similar to a user's selection.
- **Web Application**: A Flask-based web app for users to interact with the recommendation system.
- **Preprocessed Data**: Uses preprocessed data stored in `.pkl` files for efficient recommendations.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Books Dataset** from Kaggle. It contains information about books, including:
- Book titles
- Authors
- Publication year
- Publisher
- Ratings
- Reviews

Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommendation-system.git
   cd book-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.

5. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to access the web app.

---

## Usage

1. **Home Page**:
   - Displays a list of popular books based on ratings and reviews.

2. **Search for Books**:
   - Enter a book title or author to find recommendations.

3. **Get Recommendations**:
   - Click on a book to see a list of similar books based on similarity scores.
